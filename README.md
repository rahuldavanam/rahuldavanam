### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently pursuing my Master's degree in Mechatronics at the University of Siegen and having graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, I wish to make the best of both domains by contributing to the concept of computer vision, deep learning and machine learning, in particular autonomous driving.
