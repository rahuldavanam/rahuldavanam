### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently pursuing my Master's degree in Mechatronics at the University of Siegen and having graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, I wish to make the best of both domains by contributing to the concept of computer vision, deep learning and machine learning, in particular autonomous driving.

I'm currently working on developing an autonomous vehicle model on Carla Simulator. You can ask me anything related to Computer Vision, ADAS, Deep Learning and Machine Learning. As there is a learning curve to the same domains, I would also appreciate any additional insights and discussions that will expand our knowledge.
